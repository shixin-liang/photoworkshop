                    <p><b>Deadline: 4<sup>th</sup> January 2022</b></p>

                    <p>A hybrid workshop at Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg</p>

                    <p>This workshop aims to explore various aspects of knowledge (re)production involving photography
                        in twentieth-century
                        East Asia. Our construal of ‘knowledge (re)production’ is not committed to any particular
                        definition of ‘knowledge’, and
                        we rather emphasise the practical means by which things are made into ‘objects of knowledge’. In
                        our case, this includes
                        the know-how of photographic techniques and print-making, the shaping of various academic
                        disciplines, and, more
                        broadly, the dissemination of political information.</p>

                    <p>Needless to say, the twentieth century contains turbulent and drastic passages with two World
                        Wars, the Cold War, and
                        numerous protests. It also witnessed crucial artistic movements and scientific revolutions.
                        During all these historical
                        events, photography was mobilised for various purposes via diverse types of publications. Yet,
                        while photography was
                        embraced all over the world, canonised writing on photography rarely considers practices outside
                        of the Euro-American
                        arena. Our workshop, therefore, also functions as an intervention to historical narratives that
                        have long been biased
                        towards photography’s ‘core history’ and towards limited sources, often housed in colonial
                        archives.</p>

                    <p>We invite <b>20-minute presentations</b> from PhD students and post-doctoral researchers who
                        work on 20th-century photography
                        histories through perspectives from East Asia. While having a geographic focus, we acknowledge
                        the significance of
                        transcultural forces in shaping any history of photography. We thus also encourage submissions
                        with a trans-regional
                        focus and attempts to combat methodological nationalisms.</p>

                    <p>We are especially interested in contributions focussing on the practices of photography in
                        relation to the following two
                        themes:</p>

                    <p><b>(a) Photography as a tool integrated in various disciplines.</b> We enquire into the
                        interdependencies between photographs’
                        ontological fluidity and epistemological shifts in various fields of study. We welcome both case
                        studies on the use of
                        photography in different fields as well as discussions of meta-questions on the photography’s
                        possibility to cut across
                        types, genres, and ‘discursive spaces’. Contributions may address the following aspects:</p>

                    <p>
                        <li>The technological and material conditions of photography</li><br>

                        <li>Photography as means and method of art history and its role in art historical discourse</li>
                        <br>

                        <li>Photography’s role in shaping historical narratives and historiographies: its strengths and
                            limitations as historical
                            sources</li><br>

                        <li>The uses of photography in other disciplinary domains such as geography, archaeology,
                            anthropology, etc.</li><br>
                    </p>


                    <p><b>(b) Photography as political practice and other forms of ‘knowledge’ production.</b> The
                        following aspects may be addressed:<br>

                        <li>Circulation, publication, and image sharing</li><br>
                        <li>Photography in social and revolutionary movements</li><br>
                        <li>The complexity of photographic truth in relation to journalism, reportage</li><br>
                        <li>Photography as tools and products of ideologies, such as nationalism, humanism, colonialism,
                            and fascism.</li><br>
                    </p>

                    <p>Through this workshop, we strive for <b>a synthesised history of photography:</b> the workshop
                        will be one of the first
                        academic events to embrace such diverse aspects of photography with a focus on East Asia. We
                        welcome scholars from
                        diverse disciplines to explore the nature of interdisciplinarity in photographic researches. By
                        doing so, we also take
                        the ontological status of photography seriously and re-visit questions raised by Christopher
                        Pinney: Are there many
                        incompatible photographs, or is there a protean photography foregrounded by the changing
                        apparatus and technics? What
                        was happening that could not be achieved by other media? How can we account for the
                        ‘photographic event’? Do formal
                        elements matter? What about the materiality or immateriality of photography?</p>

                    <p>Through the <b>workshop format</b>, we want to strike a balance between formal elements of academic exchange and a collaborative environment that allows for
                    work-in-progress presentations and free dialogue. We will have keynote speeches, guest lectures, a book launch, a sneak
                    preview of the documentary on <a href="https://www.beijingsilvermine.com/">Beijing Silvermine</a> collection, and a library tour to one of the richest East Asian
                    magazine collections in Europe (at our CATS campus). We plan a hybrid event with an <b>in-person meeting in Heidelberg (COVID rules apply) and an online option via Zoom.</b></p>

                    <p>Participation in the workshop is free of charge thanks to the generous support of the Graduate Academy. Limited funds
                    are available to cover travel expenses.</p>

                    <p>Interested participants should submit their <b>abstracts</b> (up to 350 words) as well as a <b>CV</b> by <b>4<sup>th</sup> January 2022</b> to the email
                    address:</p>
